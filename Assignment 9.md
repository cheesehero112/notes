# Assignment 9



I know this is a bit weird, but I’m adding a final checklist so that I can figure out how to fill out the rest of the assignments. Don’t look at this yet because it will stress you out!You may notice a big gap between this and the previous assignment. By now you should have gone through the CS immersive or some equivalent of that by studying on your own. If there are knowledge gaps, you should now be able to research, investigate, and learn from these resources listed.IMPORTANT!!If you know everything on this list, you will have better odds of landing a job. It does NOT mean you should keep studying until you know all of these concepts because you can get a job knowing just 50% of this list as well. Once you’re job hunting, aim to do 2-3 interviews a week, and the top priority should be the application process. 3 interviews a week may require sending 100 applications a week for an entry level job with no prior experience. Study in your spare time after that, but do not postpone job hunting. (edited) 



### Job Ready Checklist:



##### Applying:

 LinkedIn profile should only mention software engineering. Music related things should be contained in “other interests” near the bottom
 Aim for at least 200 linkedin connections
 Have a good resume (I’ll help edit it if you’re not sure)
 IMO cover letters are a waste of time and the CS style double downs are a waste of time. You’re going to have very low odds of getting past the resume round, so just send hundreds of applications to jobs that are relevant. Your mindset should be something like.. if I apply to 1,000, that should get me 1 job
