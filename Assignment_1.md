# Assignment 1 

##### 1. Research best way to take notes

I will be taking notes including some assignments using Typora to create a markdown file, then make a repo into my Github account. This will also allow me to use Terminal regularly. 



##### 2. Look up following terms and take notes if your own words in whatever way determined from #1- machine code



##### binary

Binary is used in digital computers and based on a binary number system. It can only show two states - off and on, and usually symbolized by 0 and 1.

Everything we see in the digital world, including videos, texts, and pictures can be broken down into binary even if we can't see it. 

Side note - the word "bit" stands for binary digits.

##### executable

When a file is executable, it means that it's a file a computer can run as a process. Otherwise known as a "compiled" file. They are usually non-readable, non-editable and in binary format. 

Common file format are, .BAT, .COM, .EXE, .BIN, .DMG, .APP, .ELF, and more.

##### program

Program is a set of instructions that a computer uses to perform a specific function, like a recipe. It contains a list of ingredients (variables), directions (statements) that shows a computer how to make the dish (execute a task).

##### compile vs interpret program language

Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code, and are executable. They tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpret languages, but everytime something is changed, the file needs to be re-compiled. It's like a translated recipe book. If author decides to change ingredients, translator has to rewrite the book and republish. 

Examples of pure compiled languages: C, C++, Erland, Haskell, Rust, Go

Interpret languages run through a program line by line and execute each command. In the recipe example, It's like having a live interpretor who can communicate the ingredient change real time. It used to be slower to execute than compiled languages, but the gap is shrinking.

Examples of common interpreted languages: PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript

##### unix

UNIX (trademarked) is a multiuser, multitasking operating system designed for flexibility and adaptability. Originally developed in the 1970s with newly invented C language. It inspired many common OS such as Linux and MacOS.

##### command line and PATH

Command Line is a text interface for a computer, such as the Terminal. It allows me to talk directly to my computer. No graphics and mousing available. When I type into the terminal, I'm always issuing commands such as ls, cd, mkdir, that is why it's called the commend line.

Path is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a location in a directory structure. It is compused by following the directory tree hierarchy, and separated by a character such as "/", ":", or ";". 

Bonus: absolute path vs relative path

absolute path starts at the root of the directory tree, and could be lengthy to type. I can use relative path by referencing the current working directly (cwd) using "../foldername",  ''~/foldername/file", or simply typing "foldername" without the slash.

##### bash, zsh

Both bash and zsh are a command language that runs in most terminal immurator. In my own terminal, I am running zsh. (you can check what you are using by typying "echo $0")

##### node

(Not sure if this is the correct "node", but guessing it's referring to Node.js)

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment for server-side JavaScript applications.

##### brew

BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's OS, macOS, and Linux.

##### command line flags

##### code editor (vs code, atom, sublime, vim)Some of these terms will be defined by 2 or 3 additional terms that you don’t know, so drill into all of those new terms as well.

##### Low-level language vs. high-level language

##### Assembly code

##### JavaScript

##### JavaScript engine

##### EcmaScript

##### Browser

##### Babel

##### Transpiler



##### 3. Spend at least 5 minutes a day using command line basic commands ls, pwd, cd, cp, touch, mkdir etc.. Be extra careful when using rm so you don’t break your computer

##### 4. codecademy beginner javascript (if it’s free) or freeCodeCamp review html, css, and continue with javascript (2 hours a day)

##### 5. Go to any relevant easy codesmith free lectures https://app.codesmith.io/coding-events

##### 6. watch youtube videos of computer science fundamentals and take notes (1 hour a day)
