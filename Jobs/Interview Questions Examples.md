## Interview Questions Examples:

#### #1

```javascript
/*
Declare a variable 'myNums' and set it to an object.
On that object you will have two key-value pairs. One key will be 'favoriteNumber' and its value will be your favorite number.
The other key will be 'randomNumber' and its value will be 12.
*/
```



```
/*
Write a function 'largestSwap' that takes a two-digit number and determines if it's the largest of two possible digit swaps. 'largestSwap' should return a boolean.
For example, if 27 is our our input, we should return false because swapping the digits gives us 72, and 72 > 27.
Furthermore, if our input is 43 'largestSwap' should return true because swapping the digits gives us 34 and 43 > 34.
*/
```



```
/* Check that your 'largestSwap' function is working correctly by passing the value of 'randomNumber' on your 'myNums' object to your 'largestSwap' function
*/
```



```
/*
Create a function "countTimes" that takes in two arguments (an array and a search value). "countTimes" should return the number of times the search value is present in the array.

Example:
countTimes([1, 8, 9, 9, 10], 9) -> 2
*/
```



```
/*
Create a function called "wordSearchLetterCounter" that takes two arguments (a 2 dimensional array of letters known as our word search, and a letter that we are going to search for).
"wordSearchLetterCounter" should use your "countTimes" function to count the total number of times a letter show up in the word search.

Example:
wordSearchLetterCounter([
  ["D", "E", "Y", "H", "A", "D"],
  ["C", "B", "Z", "Y", "J", "K"],
  ["D", "B", "C", "A", "M", "N"],
  ["F", "G", "G", "R", "S", "R"],
  ["V", "X", "H", "A", "S", "S"]
], "D") âžž 3
"D" shows up 3 times: twice in first row, once in third row.
*/
```



```
/*
Create a function "changeCase" that takes in a letter as an argument, and returns the letter in the opposite case.

Examples:
changeCase('a') -> 'A'
changeCase('B') -> 'b'
*/
```



```
/*
Create a function "effectString" that takes in two arguments (a string and a callback function).
"effectString" should apply that callback function to each letter in the string and return out a new string.
*/
```



```
/* Check to that your "effectString" is working properly by passing it the string "hello WORLD" and the callback function "changeCase"
*/
```





```
/*
Write a function "passwordSafe" that takes two arguments: a string which will be the password, and a value which will be the "safe". "passwordSafe" should return a function that takes in a password as a string.
If that password doesn't match the one originally provided, return the string "You have entered the wrong password". If the passwords do match, return the safe.

Example:
const mySafe = passwordSafe('myPassword', 'My Super Secret');
mySafe('wrongPassword') -> "You have entered the wrong password"
mySafe('myPassword') -> "My Super Secret"
*/
