# Assignment 4

### terms and concepts:classes vs functions

- prototypal inheritance

- constructor function
- what is a prototype
- what is a dunder proto
- synchronous vs asynchronous
- web api
- framework



**React Resources:**

Look for Udemy sales for:

- “JavaScript: The Advanced Concepts (2022 Update)” by Andrei Neagoie,

- “Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and ..” by Jonas Schmedtmann,

- “JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass” by Colt Steele,

  

**Work on:** 

- Andrew section 10, 11 - this is the core curriculum. It’s going to be the hardest part, and you’ll learn the definitions of the terms through these classes
  - bonus: After Andrew’s section 11, do the weekly algo from this week (save that screenshot somewhere)
- At least a few algos a day (FCC ‘basic js’ and ‘es6’). This should feel easy compared to Andrew, and you can use it as a breather task.
  - basic JS finished (8/24/22)
- FCC js OOP - this should be paired with Andrew section 10 work. Go back and forth until you see what’s happening. 
  - Finished 8/25/22
- React class - *ideally* you finish all of the above in 2 weeks. If you can’t, don’t worry. We will switch to React a month before your immersive starts no matter where you are. From that point on, you’ll just focus on this new Andrew udemy class



### coding challenge: 

Create a new string method called `announceFirstChar()` such that this will work:

(`char` is short for “character”) 

```
const myStr = “Hi”;

myStr.announceFirstChar();  // logs “The first char is H” (edited) 
```
