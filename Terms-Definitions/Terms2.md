##### CLI (command line interface) or command line tools vs GUI

- CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

- Command line tools are scripts, programs, and libraries that have been created with a unique purpose to solve a problem. Most of these tools are open-source projects and free. See the list of 50 Cool Tools to Improve Your Workflow. https://stackify.com/top-command-line-tools/#Productivity

- GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software. (i.e. - Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows)

##### Git vs gitHub and version control

- Git is an open-source version control system developers install locally to manage source code. It also tracks every changes in computer files and helps coorginating work among several people and tracking progress. No GUI.

- GitHub is an online (cloud) service to which developers who use Git and connect and upload or download resources. It provides an easy to use GUI.

##### Be familiar with names of other popular computer languages

- JavaScript (web development, game development, mobile apps, building web servers)
- Python (backend development, data science, app development)
- HTML (web doc, web development, web maintenance)
- CSS (web doc, web development, web design)
- Java (E-commerce, finance, app development)
- SQL (database management, sales reports, business management)
- NoSQL (Non-relational SQL - improvement to SQL's scalability)
- C# (game development, desktop/web/mobile apps, VR)
- Rust (operating systems, VR, web browsers)
- Perl (ststem admin, GUI development, network programming)
- Go (system/ network programming, audio/video editing, big data)

##### Dynamically typed languages vs statically typed languages

- In Dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is check during run-time. Example languages include JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Tcl.

  For example, dynamically-type languages do not require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them.

  Python Example:

  ```python
  data = 10;
  data = “Hello World!”; // no error caused
  ```



- In Statically typed languages, the type of a variable is known at compile-time instead of at run time. Example languages include Java, C, C++, FORTRAN, Pascal, and Scala.

  For example, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them

  Java Example:

  ```java
  int data;
  data = 50;
  data = “Hello World!”; // causes an compilation error
  ```

  ##### Bonus: Strongly-typed languages vs Weakly-typed languages

  - Strongly-typed language is one in which variables are bound to specific date types and will result in type errors if types do not match up as expected in the expression, regardless of when type checking occurs. Examples of languages include Python and Java.

    Python Example:

    ```python
    temp = “Hello World!”
    temp = temp + 10; // program terminates with below stated error
    ```

  - Weakly-typed languages is one in which variables are not bound to a specific data type. They still have a type but type safety constraints are lower compared to strongly-type languages. Examples of languages include PHP and C.

    PHP Example:

    ```php
    $temp = “Hello World!”;
    $temp = $temp + 10; // no error caused
    echo $temp;
    ```

##### Function vs Method

##### Function Declaration vs Function Expression (specifically in js)

##### Front-end vs back-end. Research this for about 30 minutes (no more than that) using multiple resources while writing any questions about this topic

- Front-end is the user-side requesting information (i.e.- when I go to YouTube using Chrome, I'm on the front-end). CSS, HTML, JavaScript are the common front-end languages. All the code runs on the browser.
- Back-end is the server-side providing infromation back to the front-end. PHP, Python, Ruby, C#. All the code runs on the server and only the results are return to the front-end (browser)
- A term full-stack developer is referred to someone who can work on both front-end and back-end.
